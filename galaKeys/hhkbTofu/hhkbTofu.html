                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Since I had gotten my HHKB (Happy Hacking Keyboard) back in 2016, the layout quickly became one of my favorites. I had found it awkward having my pinky reach all the way back to the lower left corner to press CTRL, and since then the mechanical community scene has grown enough to the point I could get a budget-priced MX-style custom HHKB.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The HHKB Tofu is a 60% keyboard with the biggest difference being the HHKB blockers (where the CRTL is supposed to be), as there is no more Caps Lock with CTRL taking its place above the left shift key. This keyboard was also my first hot-swap keyboard, allowing me to test out multiple switches. I had originally bought this keyboard with stock Roselios (67g silent linears), but I found them too heavy while typing or doing any sort of gaming. I went out to look for other types of switches that would potentially fit my taste, and ended on the Novelkey Creams, a linear switch from Novelkeys.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The NK Creams are of course a good switch, but people have their mixed feelings on whether they compete with other high-end linear switches like JWK Linears (Alpacas, Mauves, etc.). When comparing the NK Creams to other switches, there’s a number of things to take into consideration. Often times people will look for a nice sound and a smooth feel. Although the NK Creams have a nice sound when the keys come back up, the push feeling can be controversial. Some people enjoy the “leathery” feeling of the switch, where it isn’t as smooth as something like a JWK, whereas others despise it, describing the feeling as closer to “scratchy”. In my experience, the switches heavily benefit from "breaking-in", which is done by actuating the switch without lubricant to break down the material and smoothen the switch, emulating years of use. However, if you were to use these switches out of the box with some lube, you will experience some texture in the push feel.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When lubed, I would describe it like a skateboard grinding a rail. When you wax the rail (the equivalent of lube), you lower the friction of the ride and now the grind is smoother. However, you still feel the grinding of the board against the rail, like how you can feel the stem of the switch moving against the housing.

            <p class="articleContent">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This Tofu case is made out of aluminum and feels premium. Fingerprints don’t shine or show easily. The case is a very solid, clean, sturdy case. But as every other Tofu is, the corners are extremely pointy and sharp, not something that you’d like to hit your arm with at all. On the back of the keyboard fits a brass weight that you can shift from left to right for the USB slot, depending on the direction you want your cable to come from. It’s held in by strong magnets, so you don’t have to worry about it falling out.

            <p class="articleContent">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The keyboard is portable and easy to fit into a carry-on. It has a nice weight to it and doesn’t feel cheap when you hold it, but isn’t extremely heavy either. Mine comes in at around 2.4 pounds, or 1.1 kg.
            </p>
            <p class="articleContent">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The only personal modifications I added was a little bit of cloth to help dampen the hollowness of the keyboard. This was a little experiment of mine to compare it to dampening foam, but it doesn’t serve its purpose as well as foam does.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My reason for changing keyboards was because I wasn’t fond of the Zealios on my first Tofu and I missed the HHKB layout. Getting a hot-swap PCB was also a nice addition, so I ended up with this keyboard because it was still within my price range at the time.
            </p>
            <p class="articleContent">
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The biggest issue was that I never saw myself using this as my daily driver as I started to miss my arrow and macro keys. Doing any computer activity that requires these keys makes it really difficult to want to use the HHKB layout in the long run.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I hope that this can give you an insight into what I look for in a keyboard. I didn’t go too far in depth with any of the switches or how the material affects the sound, but tried my best to give my thoughts on the experience I had with the HHKB Tofu.
