        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My family being originally from Malaysia, I had always wanted to support the South-east Asia keyboard market, 
        and was pleasantly surprised to see a collaboration between two well-known entities 
        within the mechanical keyboard industry. Monokei, a company based in Singapore/Malaysia, and Yuktsi, 
        the maker of the famous TGR Jane, collaborated together in the MONOKEI x Friends campaign to create the 
        first ever unlimited group-buy TGR keyboard: the Tomo.

         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I had been using the Owlab Spring for 8 months, and that build is the epitome of what I would consider 
        a “2020s keyboard”: tons of flex, filled with PE and case foam, using new switches like Pewters and 
        Original Aspiration linears, essentially the furthest thing away from “traditional”. The TGR Tomo has 
        put me right back where I started: no PE foam, fancy mounting style, or unique layout; just your 
        traditional top mount aluminum case keyboard.

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Tomo is a top-mount 75% keyboard with the ability to also be gummy O-ring mounted. This combination 
            of top-mount and gummy O-ring mount capabilities have become much more popular, as the latter has become 
            the standard alternative in keyboards like the TGR Jane. The top-mount would involve the PCB, plate, and
            switches all being screwed onto the top enclosure for a stiffer typing experience, whereas O-ring mount 
            wraps a large rubber O-ring around the package to emulate a gasket mount. This allows the PCB and plate 
            to be friction fitted for a more bouncy and forgiving feel.
