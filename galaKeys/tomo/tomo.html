        <p class="articleContent">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My family being originally from Malaysia, I had always wanted to support the Southeast Asian keyboard market, 
        and was pleasantly surprised to see a collaboration between two well-known entities 
        within the mechanical keyboard industry. Monokei, a company based in Singapore/Malaysia, and Yuktsi, 
        the maker of the famous TGR Jane, collaborated together in the MONOKEI x Friends campaign to create the 
        first ever unlimited group-buy TGR keyboard: the Tomo.
        </p>
        <p class="articleContent">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I had been using the Owlab Spring for 8 months, and that build is the epitome of what I would consider 
        a “2020s keyboard”: tons of flex, filled with PE and case foam, using new switches like Pewters and 
        Original Aspiration linears, essentially the furthest thing away from “traditional”. The TGR Tomo has 
        put me right back where I started: no PE foam, fancy mounting style, or unique layout; just your 
        traditional top mount aluminum case keyboard.
        </p>
        <p class="largeText">Interior</p>
        <p class="articleContent">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Tomo is a top-mount 75% keyboard with the ability to also be gummy O-ring mounted. This combination 
            of top-mount and gummy O-ring mount capabilities have become much more popular, as the latter has become 
            the standard alternative in keyboards like the TGR Jane. The top-mount would involve the PCB, plate, and
            switches all being screwed onto the top enclosure for a stiffer typing experience, whereas O-ring mount 
            wraps a large rubber O-ring around the package to emulate a gasket mount. This allows the PCB and plate 
            to be friction fitted for a more bouncy and forgiving feel.
        </p>
        <figure class="articleImage">

            <figcaption>O-ring sandwiched in between PCB and Case</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="articleContent">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For further detail on the sound and feel of the different mounting styles, 
            I have a section dedicated towards that. But in regards to the case itself, 
            I despise the O-ring mount installation process. This involves putting the 
            O-ring around the PCB and plate, and then slowly wiggling and pushing that 
            whole enclosure into the top portion of the case. With more experience, 
            you may find this easier, but I have always found O-ring mount installation 
            to be irritating and time-consuming. I forced the O-ring into place using 
            a flat-head screwdriver, and this took me around 10-15 minutes. It isn’t 
            a huge time sink, but can be frustrating, especially if you end up putting 
            too much pressure on either the top or the sides, bumping the O-ring out 
            before you can screw the whole case together. Top mount installation is far
            simpler, only requiring 7 screws to have the PCB and plate installed onto 
            the top part of the case.
        </p>
        <p class="articleContent">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The badge in the top right is also secured with two screws on the top part
            of the case, and is interchangable.
        </p>
        <p class="articleContent">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Tomo comes with case and PCB foam, which helps reduce the hollowness that
            comes with a lot of top mount keyboards. You can opt to use no foam, however from
            previous experience, I would recommend leaving at least the case foam in to reduce
            any hollowness. The PCB foam can also add to the fullness in the sound signature, but
            can be removed in favor of a higher-pitched clack.

        <img src="pics/tomoWeight.jpg">
        <p class="articleContent">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Tomo’s back weight design is iconic in its own right. 
            This design is near identical to that of the TGR Jane, featuring the brass badge 
            sunken in the aluminum case. The color contrast between the aluminum and the brass 
            allow the Tomo engraving to stand out, where it is surrounded by the TGR and Monokei 
            engravings. It is absolutely stunning, and is certainly my favorite back weight design 
            out of all the keyboards I’ve built or even seen.
        </p>
        <p class="articleContent">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The case itself is held together by eight screws in the back, 
            which more when comparing with most other keyboards (Mode Eighty uses 3, Owlab Spring 
            uses 6). Some people may prefer to see less screws, especially if they are used to 
            screw-less designs or if they want to adjust their builds often. Personally, it isn’t 
            a deal-breaker, but I do miss the cleanliness that non-visible screw designs have.
        </p>
        <img src="pics/tomoBadge.jpg">
        <p class="articleContent">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The front view features a badge in the top right corner of the keyboard. Many people 
            have controversial opinions about this, but it isn’t as obtrusive as some other designs 
            like the Think 6.5 or even the TGR 910. I would have loved to see the F-row spaced out 
            a little bit more to have a brand-less design, but the badge is a nice bit of flair to 
            give the keyboard a little more character. Some people expressed their desire for a knob, 
            but I find knobs unpractical and unseemly, so having the badge instead is fine.
        </p>
        <p class="largeText" style="font-size: 15px;">Layout</p>
        <img src="pics/tomoWindow.jpg">
        <p class="articleContent">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Tomo’s layout can be described as “sufficiently compact”. It features an F13 layout, 
            which shifts the function keys slightly to the left in order to make space for the additional 
            key. In addition, I had noticed that the F-row felt slightly closer to the alphanumeric keys 
            than they did with the Mode Eighty. This might seem subtle, but I had found this to be one of 
            my favorite change going from the Eighty to the Tomo. It was much easier to locate the function 
            keys while coding and gaming.
        </p>
        <p class="articleContent">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Tomo also does not have the arrow keys exploded, or separate 
            from the rest of the alphanumeric keys. Thus, the keyboard functions like a 65% but with 
            F-keys. This does feel nice, coming to this from 65% keyboards in comparison to the 
            exploded 75%s (like the Satisfaction 75 or the GMMK Pro, for example). Overall, I love 
            the layout and how it comes together feeling like one solid package, with the F-keys 
            slightly closer yet maintaining enough of a distance to be separate from the alphanumerics, 
            and the rest of the keyboard feeling like home, in a nice 65% layout.

        <img src="pics/tomoSwitch.jpg">
        <p class="articleContent">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For this build, I decided to use broken-in MX Browns, which I have preferred over the 
            Pewters as of recent. Pewters were designed as linears with a slight “rumble”, which 
            left me desiring just a little more tactility. In addition, as a JWK switch, the sound 
            of the Pewters was lacking the deepness that Cherry housings offer. Initially, I also 
            wanted to stick to a more traditional build for the Tomo, so instead of using another 
            aftermarket switch, I went with Cherry. The slight scratch that Cherry switches have 
            can be irritating at first, but after the break-in period, the scratch becomes a 
            smoothed texture when applied over with Tribosys 3203. Although not as smooth as JWK 
            switches, the slight texture from every press is weirdly comforting. I filmed these 
            switches with Dangkeebs Gasket Switch Films. Filming MX Browns probably isn’t necessary, 
            but I had some lying around so I figured I might as well.
        </p>
        <p class="articleContent">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I spring-swapped these with 63.5g Tecsee double-staged springs, 
            which make switches so much more exciting. These double-staged springs have two different 
            weights, they start light, and go heavy after pressing down to a certain point. They 
            give a bounciness that progressive springs dream of, which adds to the overall enjoyment 
            of the typing experience. Some people might not like this, but I found myself adjusting 
            to it within hours and it became my new spring preference, as single-staged springs felt 
            stale in comparison. I would highly recommend anyone to try out a couple if they want to 
            spice up their switches.

        <p class="largeText" style="font-size: 15px;margin-top: 15px;">Mounting Styles: O-ring mount versus Top mount</p>
        <p class="articleContent">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For the first three weeks with this build, I used the O-ring mount 
            (which is what the typing test below features). Coming from the flexibility and bounciness 
            that the Spring had offered, the O-ring mount was a nice transition into a slightly stiffer 
            mechanism. In tandem with a PC plate, this Tomo build can’t compare with the leaf spring 
            mount in terms of flex, but it has a slight forgiveness that one might expect out of a 
            normal gasket mount keyboard.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="articleContent">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I then switched over to the top mount. Top mount keyboards generally 
            deliver a fuller sound, and the Tomo did not fail there. However, there was a little bit of 
            sharpness, so I tried out the force break mod, which involves putting a little bit of tape 
            next to the screw holes to avoid metal-on-metal contact. This supposedly removes a lot of 
            pinging that you might get in lower-end keyboards, but with the Tomo, I still found that the 
            mod reduced the harsh sounds.
        </p>
        <p class="articleContent">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For feel, the top mount has obviously less flex than the O-ring mount, 
            as the PCB and plate are held by screws instead of friction-fit with rubber, but with the PC 
            plate, it remains less firm than any aluminum or brass build (comparing this to the aluminum 
            plate in the Mode Eighty and the brass plate in the M65-B). After typing on the top mount 
            keyboard for hours, I feel no fatigue when I normally would in a brass build.
        </p>
        <p class="articleContent">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In terms of sound, the difference between the O-ring mount and the 
            top mount in terms of mounting style is exactly what you hear. In an O-ring mount, there 
            is going to be more space left for sound to travel through the plate and PCB in comparison 
            to a top mount that is screwed down. That space makes the switches sound lighter, akin to a 
            “hollower” sound signature. The top mount completely takes that away, making the keyboard 
            sound fuller. 
        </p>
        <p class="articleContent">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This second sound test is my current build: top mount with force 
            break mod, and with NK Creams on the mods instead of MX Browns, so the spacebar will sound
            a little different in comparison to the first, but the difference should be able to be heard
            in the alphas.

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Tomo is not a ground-breaking keyboard, but it is another successful kit that goes under 
            Yuktsi’s stacked keyboard resume. I believe that TGR keyboards are some of the best when it 
            comes to the traditional top-mount design, and the Tomo is no exception. I hope that keyboards 
            like this continue to find success in a market full of industry-breaking innovations, and 
            am excited to see whatever comes next out of the Southeast Asian keyboard scene.
