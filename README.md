# Webpage
The plan for this webpage is to act as a portfolio to feature some of my projects as well as to eventually port my old website [galaKeys](https.galakeys.com) to reduce yearly fees.
### Motivation
When first creating my website dedicated to keyboards (galaKeys), I did not have an interest in front-end development. However, as years passed, I developed a passion for coding and computer science while going through my degree at NYU. I started to identify as a programmer, which resulted in this weird feeling of wanting a website made by myself instead of using a platform like Wordpress.

This project will help me develop front-end skills and try different frameworks as new ones get developed during my journey to becoming a full-stack developer.
