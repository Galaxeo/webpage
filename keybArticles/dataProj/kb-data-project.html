            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the 2010s, there was a consensus around mechanical 
            keyboards that linear switches were designed for gaming and tactile/clicky 
            switches were made for a better typing experience. This was evident when the 
            Cherry MX Red linear switch was first revealed in 2008 and was introduced to 
            focus on the gaming market as a lighter version of the MX Black, cutting the 
            actuation force by 25% (60g to 45g). However, the marketing on these switches 
            has since slowly started to switch towards the promotion of the keyboard itself 
            as a gaming product. Switches are no longer marketed individually as “gaming” or 
            “typing”, but rather as different options available to the customer. This can be 
            seen in Logitech’s marketing, where they state the difference between the switches 
            and put them all under the umbrella of a “gaming” switch.

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The primary goal of this project was to first see if this 
            statement remained true; that linears were preferred by gamers and tactiles for the 
            typing experience. So, I created a survey to try and look for any additional 
            correlations around switch choice and to hopefully visualize some of the data gathered. 
            A lot of what’s in this project is theoretical and although the data gathered 
            here isn’t the best, I hope to introduce some data visualization and analysis with keyboards.

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For those unfamiliar with mechanical keyboard switches, 
            this is a brief expalantion of mechanical switches: Tactile switches will have a 
            small bump somewhere in the middle of a press indicating the switch has been 
            actuated. Linear switches feel the same until you bottom out, which is when 
            you press the switch in all the way (meaning no feedback as to when the switch 
            actuates). Clicky switches are very similar to tactiles, however have a clicking 
            mechanism that creates a much more audible sound when you actuate the switch.
